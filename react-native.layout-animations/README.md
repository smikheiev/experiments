# Idea

I lacked an understanding of how to use layout animations with Reanimated, so I decided to try it out. I didn't want to create anything big or fancy, just something minimal to get a basic idea of how to use them.

# Results

It's amazing how simple it is to use layout animations with Reanimated! Literally just a few lines of code.
